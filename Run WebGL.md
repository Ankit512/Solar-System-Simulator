#  How to run WebGL build locally 

## Unity WebGL build doesn't work locally in Chrome anymore so we will use Firefox to run Unity WebGL game build locally.

### We will enable the WebGL option on the browser
1. Install the Firefox browser on your PC/Laptop.
2. Type in **about:config** in the search bar and navigate to it.
3. Search for **privacy.file_unique_origin**.
4. You will see the boolean value set to **True**. Click on the **â‡Œ** button and set the value to **False**.
5. Quit the tab and open the **index.html** file present in the **WebGL** folder.
